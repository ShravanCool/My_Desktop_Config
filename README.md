# My Desktop Configuration

This repository contains dotfiles of my development environment. While there are steps mentioned for installing and setting up the same, it's really intented for my own use- you probably won't have much success with it, and would probably be better of reading the individual dotfiles and copying the bits that interest you.

## Development tools used-

- Vim, a hands-on commmand-line editor
- Tmux, a terminal multiplexer
- Bash or zsh (I used both of them interchangeably)
- i3 WM, a tiling window manager
